## PHP programming course project:

Here is three project that I have developed during a PHP course ministered by Matheus Battisti: Blog Project, Agenda and Bookwin. There is also a project made by me called Elefante Project.
It dives into PHP, HTML and CSS as main programming languages. In the Agenda and Elefante projects I also use MySQL, PDO and Bootstrap.
